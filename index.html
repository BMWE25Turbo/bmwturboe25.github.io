    <h1>BMW Turbo (E25) - 1972 Prototype</h1>

    <strong>Print Style:</strong> Rare dry-mounted German issue<br>
    <strong>Known Copies:</strong> 3 worldwide (U.S., Germany, Canada), but there very well probably are a few more in existence<br>
    <strong>Poster Dimensions:</strong> ~94 × 63 cm (with frame)</p>

    <h2>The Story</h2>
    <p class="quote">This is the BMW Turbo E25. Only two were ever built. It’s the concept that led to the M1 — mid-engine, gullwing doors, wild for its time. This poster was probably a BMW Museum gift shop print from the 70s or 80s, professionally mounted back when dry-mounting was the norm. I’ve only seen two others online — one in Germany, one in Ontario, Canada. You won’t find it on Amazon, you won’t find it on forums — it basically doesn’t exist unless you already have one. Total garage sale fluke. It’s one of the rarest things I own.</p>
